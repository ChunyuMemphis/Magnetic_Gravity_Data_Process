# Magnetic_Gravity_Data_Process

The folder "process_data" includes a matlab code "process_data.m" which is used to do all the processing. 

The folder "plot" includes a macro " plot_cen_maggrav" written by Christine Powell and Modified by myself. 

One can do detrend, upward continuation, reduce to pole, vertical derivative, and horizontal derivative.
